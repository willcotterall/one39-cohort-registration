    question: 'What exactly is the Creative Circle?',
    answer: 'Creative Circle is a 10-month coaching cohort for worship leaders and creative directors who want to fundamentally transform their Sunday experience. You\'ll be paired with one of four world-class coaches and work through six proprietary frameworks designed to create lasting, structural change in how you lead worship.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who is this for?',
    answer: 'This is for worship leaders, music directors, creative pastors, and anyone responsible for shaping the Sunday worship experience at their church. Whether you lead a room of 50 or 5,000, the frameworks are designed to scale. This is not for beginners looking to learn songs — it\'s for leaders ready to build systems.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does the schedule look like?',
    answer: 'The cohort meets virtually twice per month starting April 1, 2026. Sessions are live with your assigned coach and cohort group. Between sessions, you\'ll have framework assignments and implementation tasks to apply directly to your church context. Expect to invest 4–6 hours per month.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I switch coaches after registration?',
    answer: 'Coach assignments are made during registration and cohort groups are built around each coach. Switching after the cohort begins is not available, as each coach leads a specific track. Choose the coach whose leadership style and expertise best aligns with where you want to grow.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the refund policy?',
    answer: 'Full refunds are available up to 14 days before the cohort start date (April 1, 2026). After that, no refunds are issued but you may transfer your spot to another qualified leader. Monthly payment plans can be canceled at any time, but access ends at cancellation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I\'m part of a larger team — is there a group rate?',
    answer: 'Yes. Group registration is available for teams of 3–8 people at $1,200/month or $10,000 one-time. For teams larger than 8, contact kylie@one39.co for custom pricing. Group members share a coach but each receive individual access to all frameworks and materials.',
