  'Most worship leaders were never taught how to lead a room. They were taught songs, chords, and setlists — but not the science behind why a room moves or why it doesn\'t. Creative Circle exists to close that gap.',
  'This is not another conference high that fades by Monday. It\'s a 10-month coaching cohort designed to create lasting, structural change in how you lead worship and how your church experiences Sunday.',
  'We believe Sunday is not a moment — it is a responsibility. The atmosphere your team creates, the systems you build, the culture you install — these are the things that determine whether people encounter God or simply attend a service.',
  'Creative Circle gives you the frameworks, the accountability, and the coaching access to build something that doesn\'t depend on your best day — it depends on your best systems.',
